Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes the best movies of the last decade, based on various key performance indicators, such as critics' ratings, audience scores, box office earnings, and more. The visualizations allow us to explore trends, comparisons, and relationships between factors that influence a movie’s success. The dataset includes movie information like budget, runtime, and box office performance in the US, Canada, and worldwide.

The project utilizes Tableau to showcase a variety of charts, from basic line and bar charts to advanced visualizations like heatmaps, treemaps, bullet graphs, and dual-axis charts. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into what makes a movie stand out in terms of both critical and commercial success.
Data Source
The dataset used for this project contains the following fields:

Title: The name of the movie.
Genre: The movie's genre (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy, etc.).

Visualizations and Insights
The Tableau project presents a variety of visualizations to analyze the data:

Line Chart: Tracks the evolution of movie earnings and ratings over the years.
Area Chart: Visualizes the relationship between movie budgets and box office performance across genres.
Histograms: Distribute movies based on their ratings and earnings to identify trends.
Heatmaps: Show correlations between different factors, like critics' scores vs. audience ratings.
Treemaps: Break down the movies by genre and their overall earnings, providing a visual representation of box office success.
Bullet Graph: Compares the movie’s budget to its box office earnings.
Combined Axis Chart: Demonstrates the relationship between two metrics, like audience score and critics score, on the same axis.
Dual Axis Chart: Shows the comparison between two key factors, such as budget vs. box office earnings over the years.
Scatter Plot: Examines the relationship between critics' ratings and audience scores for each movie.
Bar Chart: Compares the box office earnings by genre.
Boxplot: Visualizes the distribution of critics' scores or audience ratings.
Key Insights
Trends in Box Office Success: Over the decade, action movies and sequels dominated the box office, with specific years seeing spikes in worldwide earnings.
Critics vs. Audience Scores: Some genres, such as animated movies, tend to have a strong alignment between critics and audience ratings, while others, like horror, show more divergence.
Budget to Earnings Ratio: Some movies with lower budgets performed unexpectedly well, suggesting that critical success can sometimes be more significant than budget size.
