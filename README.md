Best Movies of the Decade
Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes the best movies of the last decade, based on various key performance indicators, such as critics' ratings, audience scores, box office earnings, and more. The visualizations allow us to explore trends, comparisons, and relationships between factors that influence a movieâ€™s success. The dataset includes movie information like budget, runtime, and box office performance in the US, Canada, and worldwide.

The project utilizes Tableau to showcase a variety of charts, from basic line and bar charts to advanced visualizations like heatmaps, treemaps, bullet graphs, and dual-axis charts. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into what makes a movie stand out in terms of both critical and commercial success.
